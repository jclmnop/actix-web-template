# actix-web template

Just a very basic template which I plan to use for any future actix-web applications.

## CI

- Add protection rule for trunk
- Write unit and integration tests in `/tests` dir
  - Can also write embedded unit tests if something non-public needs to be tested
- Add workflow files from `.github/` dir as checks for PRs to master and commits to master
